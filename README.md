# SPISDCARD
Modified FatFs version from the one generated by CubeMX, SPI for SD Card on STM32F411xx

I had an issue with fatfs middleware generated by CubeMX to work with SD Cards in SPI Mode.
I've adapted and modified some stuff in the middleware to work perfectly on my Nucleo64.
Code and project is for STM32F411RE but can be easily adapted to any STM32 Device, you just need
an SPI interface with software Chip Select, and this middleware.

Cheers
